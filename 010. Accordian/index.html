                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create
                        great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the
                        hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic
                        syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to
                        HTML to style it.

                        JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that allows
                        developers to create interactive web pages. It's a
                        client-side scripting language that's a core technology
                        of the World Wide Web.

                        React lets you build user interfaces out of individual
                        pieces called components. Create your own React
                        components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then
                        combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

                        Node.js is a free, open-source JavaScript runtime
                        environment that allows developers to run JavaScript
                        code outside of a web browser. It's used to create
                        server-side web applications, such as dynamic page
                        content, real-time communication programs, and browser
                        games.
